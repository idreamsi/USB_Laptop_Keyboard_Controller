The Teensy LC is obsolete. Use the Teensy 4p0 for new builds.

The Lenovo_T61_keyboard_LC.ino code is just for the keyboard. Once you get it working, try the keyboard and TP (combined) code. 
If there's a problem communicating with the TP, it can make the keyboard code erratic and not work. Debug the TP connection problems separately.
