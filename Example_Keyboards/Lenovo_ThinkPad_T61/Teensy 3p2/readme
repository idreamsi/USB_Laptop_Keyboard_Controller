The Teensy 3.2 is obsolete. Use the Teensy 4p0 for new builds.

The ZIP file is a gerber file created for JLCPCB fabrication.
It's best to use the Lenovo_T61_keyboard.ino code first to confirm the keyboard is working by itself. Then try the keyboard and TP code or the standalone TP code. 
If there's a problem communicating with the TP, it can make the keyboard code erratic and not work. Debug the TP connection problems separately.
